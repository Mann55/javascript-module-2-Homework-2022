/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

*/

let bicycle = {
  brand: "Assembled by Ali Express",
  model: "Unknown",
  color: "blue",
  horsepower: 115,
  doors: 5,
};
